// API tests are integration-style: each makeTestApp() runs `prisma migrate
// deploy` against a fresh SQLite file and argon2-hashes passwords. On slower
// CI runners (e.g. the self-hosted Gitea act_runner) the default 5s timeout
// is too tight — a single test that does several awaited API round-trips can
// legitimately take longer. Raise the per-test and per-hook ceilings.
//
// Serialize file-level execution (maxWorkers:1 + fileParallelism:false) so
// the better-sqlite3 / Prisma native-handle teardown races don't pile up
// across parallel workers — that race produced a SIGABRT (exit 134) on
// Node 22 in CI run 347 AFTER all assertions had already passed.
// teardownTimeout gives each file's afterAll() room to $disconnect() Prisma
// cleanly. (vitest 4 removed poolOptions; `forks + singleFork:true` is now
// expressed as `pool:'forks' + maxWorkers:1`. Default isolation is kept
// deliberately — do NOT set isolate:false.)
